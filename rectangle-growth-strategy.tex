\label{chap:rectangle-growth}
Given a working definition of structure in a mesh, we build on this definition and introduce structure detection algorithms.

\section{Key concepts}
An \emph{absolute structured position} refers to the position of a structured element with respect to the boundaries of its structured region.
A \emph{relative structured position} refers to the position of a structured element with respect to other structured elements within its structured region. Figure~\ref{fig:structured-position} shows this through an example.

\section{Properties of detection algorithms}

\subsection{Eager detection}
An eager (or greedy) detection algorithm will include every structured element it finds immediately, regardless of the long term consequences. While this strategy may lead to suboptimal results, it avoids backtracking the structure detection which may be prohibitively costly. Figure~\ref{fig:eager-detection} depicts the sub-optimality of eager detection in contrast with non-eager detection.

}
\caption{Eager versus non-eager detection. The dotted region represents unstructured elements. Blue cells denote structured elements detected as forming a rectangular structured region; white cells denote the remaining structured elements.\label{fig:eager-detection}}
\end{figure}



\subsection{Contiguous detection}
\label{subsec:contiguous-detection}
An algorithm which exhibits continuous detection always adds a structured element which is contiguous to the structured region thus far. The implication is that the relative structured position is always known. This greatly simplifies detection, as all adjacent structured elements are known at any point in time, and structured elements need not be repositioned in the structured region. Figure~\ref{fig:contiguous-detection} contrasts contiguous detection with non-contiguous detection.

In the case of non-contiguous detection, any non-contiguous blobs need to be consolidated. These blobs may be one of three cases:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Disjoint:

These may simply be taken as two separate structured regions.

\item Compatible:

The blobs can be merged in a lossless manner to form a single structured region.

\item Incompatible:

The blobs cannot be merged without loss of structure due to inconsistencies between the blobs. It is then necessary to discard some structured elements.
\end{enumerate}

Examples of the three cases are shown in figure~\ref{fig:non-contiguous-detection}.

\subsection{Post processing requirements}
Different algorithms will require different levels of post-processing in order to yield a rectangular structured region. Some may require a simple operation, such as trimming incomplete rows, while others may require more complex operations to achieve this goal.


\subsection{Detection traversal patterns}
The order in which structured elements are detected in a structured region is important; it imposes some constraints on the data structure representing it. Given the dimensions of the structured region, and knowledge of the absolute structured positions of elements as they are discovered, a simple 2D array allocation would suffice. Any detection order, as is convenient, may be used in this case. However, neither of those facts are known a priori in general.

Various detection traversals orders and their merits are discussed below. Figure~\ref{fig:detection-traversal-patterns} outlines some examples.

\subsubsection{Single-row append-only}
\label{append-detection}
The structured region is grown in a constant direction, for example a single row of structured elements, appended to consecutively. This can be implemented efficiently using either a singly-linked list or a dynamic array with amortized constant time append operation.

\subsubsection{Single-row append/prepend}
\label{append-prepend-detection}
The structured region is grown in either of two directions, for example a single row of structured elements, appended and prepended to. This can be implemented efficiently using a double-ended queue with amortized constant time append and prepend operations.

\subsubsection{Row-oriented detection}
The structured region is represented as a group of rows, with the elements in individual rows grown using one of the above methods. The order in which the rows themselves are grown may also utilize the same methods, with a nested data structure being a suitable implementation. For example, if rows are detected in an append-only fashion, and the individual elements are detected using append and prepend operations, then a suitable data structure would be a singly-linked list of double-ended queues.

\subsubsection{Indeterminate order detection}
The structured region is grown in a non-linear order: grown elements may not always be contiguous to the structured region thus far. If the growth is indeed non-contiguous, the relative structured positions are \emph{not} always known, and structured elements may need to be repositioned. A possible implementation would be a jagged 2D array, that is an array of arrays, which is expanded as needed. A flat-array-based 2D array would (in the worst case) require reallocating all elements upon expansion, as opposed to reallocating a single row in the case of a jagged 2D array.

Assuming contiguous structure detection, then when adding a new structured element $e_{new}$ the following holds:
\begin{enumerate*}[label=\alph*)]
\item we know exactly which existing structured elements must be adjacent to $e_{new}$, and
\item we only need to check the adjacency between $e_{new}$ and existing structured elements.
\end{enumerate*}
On the other hand if structure detection is non-contiguous, then we may later discover that some structured elements are no longer mutually compatible. We thus must check the adjacency between existing structured elements as we add new ones. Figure~\ref{fig:contiguous-comparison}

\section{Detection algorithms}

\subsection{Length-first search}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Starting from a seed vertex, grow a quad.

\item The quad is grown along one axis, both forwards and backwards, as far as possible, forming the length of the structured region. This is a per-row append/prepend traversal.
\item The row grown above is extended along the orthogonal axis, both forwards and backwards, as far as possible. Each expanded row must have the length of the initial row exactly, forming the width of the structured region. This is a row-oriented append/prepend traversal.
\end{enumerate}

The detection is clearly contiguous, with all structured element insertions running in amortized constant time. Only a constant amount of extra storage is required.

The algorithm is also an eager one, deciding the length of the structured region based on the first row it detects. This simple approach, however, can result in suboptimal detection.



\subsection{Descending-staircase search}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Follow the same steps as in length-first search, with one exception: in step~\ref{step:row-expansion}, each expanded row may have a length which is at most the length of its predecessor.
\item Find the rectangle with the maximum area, using an algorithm such as XXXXXX.
\end{enumerate}



Two types of techniques exist: seed-based, and global based. A seed-based technique starts with a seed, and grows from there. A global-based technique starts with all the orthogonal axis
